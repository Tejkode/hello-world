# hello-world
Learning github.

So this is me learning to make branch from the master in github. I learnt that arepository is an entry of a particular topic/program/code/project that i want to save on github. The changes (additions/deletions) I make on a repository are called 'commits'. Still don't know what a 'pull request' is.
